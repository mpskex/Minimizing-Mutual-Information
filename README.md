Note:

- Training scripts are using fixed seed for randomized behaviors.

- Precomputed feature are used to train the hash network. So you need to collect features from datasets before you train the hash networks.

- you can download the ImageNet dataset [here](https://github.com/thuml/HashNet/tree/master/caffe) and please extract the file in ./data/imagenet
