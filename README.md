You can used [precomputed feature](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dcm6v4KTx4i6L3JqknhpWDFOb0RXPtRx?usp=sharing) from VGG-16 to train.

Note:

- Training scripts are using fixed seed for randomized behaviors.

- Precomputed feature are used to train the hash network. So you need to collect features from datasets before you train the hash networks.

- you can download the NUS-Wide and MSCOCO dataset [here](https://github.com/thuml/HashNet/tree/master/caffe) and please extract the file.
